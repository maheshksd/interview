1) Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree

* Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph
  that is a tree and connects all the vertices together
* A single graph can have many different spanning trees
* A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected,
  undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree
